# numpy-intro-workshop
An introductory NumPy workshop that goes through some exercises

### How to get set up:

1. Clone this repository onto your own computer, in whatever directory you'd like. If you are on windows, you probably
need to download Git (https://git-scm.com/download/win) to get set up.
2. Open your terminal and change directories into wherever you cloned this repository.
3. Once you're in the repository, type `activate caispp` or `source activate caispp` (if you are on Mac) to open your python
environment you should have set up earlier.
4. Once in the caispp environment, type `jupyter notebook`, which should open on a new tab in your browser.
5. You're good to go now!
